# TaxiCab_Q_Iterations

As the name suggests, the Taxi Cab environment was used in Gym and the Q Value iterations were utilized to obtain the optimal policy. The environment was modeled as an MDP with Infinite Horizon.

The coding was done for the course Stochastics Systems and Reinforcement Learning taught by Prof. Rahul Jain, at USC, in Spring 2021.
